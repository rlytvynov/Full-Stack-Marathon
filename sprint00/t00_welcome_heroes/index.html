        <h2 id = "MyAnchor">What makes a superhero?</h2>
            <p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability 
                to do them in a way that a normal person couldn&#39;t. So in order to be a superhero, <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than 
                any power a normal human being could possess</b>, and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. 
                Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.<br>For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story. 
                But if it&#39;s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. 
                If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn&#39;t do, couldn&#39;t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.</p>
